* cl-bitfields: Macros for working with bitfields in Common Lisp

  It's common when working with tools such as assemblers and hardware
  to need to manage data stored as bitfields within a fixed-width
  word. Machine code opcodes, for example, are often described in this
  way, as some bits defining the operation, some others the addressing
  mode or literal data, and so forth.

  This library provides three macros that attempt to provide bitfield
  operations in a Lisp-like fashion:

  - ~with-bitfields~ :: A destructuring bind of a bitfield pattern
    into variable that are in scope for the body forms;
  - ~make-bitfields~ :: The opposite operation, constructing a
    bitfield value from a pattern using variables already existing;
    and
  - ~with-bitfields-f~ :: A combination of both that writes any
    changes made to the variables in the pattern back into the value
    that was destructured.
